# Summary

Universal Dependencies version of syntax annotations from the GUM corpus (https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/)

# Introduction

GUM, the Georgetown University Multilayer corpus, is an open source collection of richly annotated web texts from multiple text types. The corpus is collected and expanded by students as part of the curriculum in the course LING-367 "Computational Corpus Linguistics" at Georgetown University. The selection of text types is meant to represent different communicative purposes, while coming from sources that are readily and openly available (usually Creative Commons licenses), so that new texts can be annotated and published with ease.

The dependencies in the corpus were originally annotated using Stanford Typed Depenencies (de Marneffe & Manning 2013) and converted automatically to UD using DepEdit (https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/depedit/). The rule-based conversion takes into account gold entity annotations found in other annotation layers of the GUM corpus (e.g. entity annotations). The conversion script used can found in the GUM build bot code, available from the (non-UD) GUM repository. For more details see the [corpus website](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/).

# Documents and splits

The training, development and test sets contain complete, contiguous documents, balanced for genre. Test and dev contain similar amounts of data, usually around 2,500 tokens in each genre in each, and the rest is assigned to training. There is currently less data in the genres fiction, bio and academic, but equal amounts of these are in test and dev (about one document each) and the rest is in training data. For the exact file lists in each split see:
